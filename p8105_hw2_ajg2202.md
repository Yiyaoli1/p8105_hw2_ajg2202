## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data for 2017 and 2018.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trash wheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The
dataset contains information on year, month, and trash collected,
including some specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in
our final dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation
data.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the NYC subway dataset.

``` r
nycsubway_df = 
  read_xlsx("./datanyc/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

``` r
subway_df = 
  select(nycsubway_df, line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE"), entry = as.logical(entry),route8 = as.character(route8), route9 = as.character(route9), route10 = as.character(route10),route11 = as.character(route11))
```

the dataset contains line, station\_name, station\_latitude,
station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entrance\_type, entry,
vending, ada.

the data cleaning steps contain janitor, select and recode.

the dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868\*19.

the data is not tidy, because the variables’ data types are different.

How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
nrow(distinct(subway_df,station_name, line, .keep_all = T))
```

    ## [1] 465

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
nrow(filter(distinct(subway_df,station_name, line, .keep_all = T), ada == TRUE))
```

    ## [1] 84

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
  without_vending = 
  filter(subway_df, vending == "NO")

  without_vending_allow_entrance = 
  filter(subway_df, vending == "NO") %>% 
  filter(entry == T)

proportion = 
  nrow(without_vending_allow_entrance) / nrow(without_vending)
```

Reformat data

``` r
tidy_subway = pivot_longer(subway_df, route1:route11,
                           names_to = "route_name",
                           values_to = "route_number")
```

How many distinct stations serve the A train?

``` r
A_train = 
  filter(tidy_subway, route_number =="A") %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)
```

run the A\_train, we get the answer 60.

Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
A_train = 
  filter(tidy_subway, route_number =="A") %>%
  filter(ada == "TRUE") %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)
```

run the A\_train, we get the answer 17.

## Problem 3

First step

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  read.csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_gop == "1" ~ "gop", prez_dem == "1" ~"dem")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.double(month) , month= month.abb[month]) %>% 
  select(-day,-prez_dem,-prez_gop)
```

Second step

``` r
snp_df = 
  read.csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.double(month) , month= month.abb[month]) %>%
  relocate(year,month) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

Third step

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read.csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer (Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year=as.character(year))
```

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment= 
  left_join(pols_month_df,snp_df, by= c("year" = "year","month" = "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_df, by= c("year" = "year","month" = "month"))
```

## a short description about these datasets.

The first dataset is pols\_month. The details are as follows:

There are 822 rows and 9 columns in this dataset. The dimension is 822,
9.

The variables are year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem,
sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president. (“dem” represents democratic party, “gop”
represents republican party.)

The range of years is 1947, 2015.

The second dataset is snp. The details are as follows:

There are 787 rows and 3 columns. The dimension is 787, 3.

The variables are year, month, close.

The range of years is 1950, 2015.

The third dataset is unemployment. The details are as follows:

There are 816 rows and 3 columns. The dimension is 816, 3.

The variables are year, month, unemployment.

The range of years is 1948, 2015.

Merging snp into pols\_month, and merging unemployment into the result
creates the final dataset. The details about final dataset are as
follows:

There are 822 rows and 11 columns. The dimension is 822, 11.

The variables are year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem,
sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president, close, unemployment.

The range of years is 1947, 2015.
